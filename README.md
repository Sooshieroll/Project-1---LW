Stacker Arcade Game
You start with a starting block. 
There will be blocks moving side to side and you have to land them on top of each other as similar as possible. 

For each bit that is not exactly on top of the previous block, you will lose that chunk as you continue. 
For every block that you stack, the next block will move faster ultimately making it harder to stack the next one. 

You have a goal to get the highest score possible.

ideas: 
Add a "Perfect" symbol when the blocks match right on top of each other

issues: 
how do i make it so that the block only falls when you click a button inside of canvas?

Allow pressing space bar to drop the blocks too.

changing the colors of the blocks.

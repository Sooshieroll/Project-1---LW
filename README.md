Stacker Arcade Game
You start with a starting block. 
There will be blocks moving side to side and you have to land them on top of each other as similar as possible. 

For each bit that is not exactly on top of the previous block, you will lose that chunk as you continue. 
For every block that you stack, the next block will move faster ultimately making it harder to stack the next one. 

You have a goal to get the highest score possible.

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

Started with creating a space for Canvas
Worked on the HTML & CSS to create the background for the game
Got into the JS portion with creating the blocks
Started with creating the functions for the next step (block) & the game over function to indicate that the game is over if met. 

Creating and understanding the moving blocks was definitely the most difficult for me. I needed to make it so that the blocks don't just directly stack on top of each other. 
When they fall, the difference needed to also be taken away making the game just a bit harder as our score went up.
Also needed to make it so that as the score went up, the blocks moved side to side faster. 

Overall, wanted it to be a game you slowly advance in but will continue to try. Easy and hard at the same time. 

As i was playing my game, i kept clikcing but to mimic the actual arcade stacker in arcades, i added the ability to drop the block with space bar. 
In the arcade, you just push a big red button to drop the blocks. 


Need to Work on/ would like to make better
- Adding audio to the dropping blocks
- Create popups for certain actions
- Make the game look more appealing
- Create different levels of difficulty
- make instructions into a button that expands
